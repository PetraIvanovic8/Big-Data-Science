# Big Data Science

This repository is a detailed documentation of the most relevant work done in an NYU Computer Science graduate course called ‘Big Data Science’. This course provided me with a comprehensive exploration into cutting-edge techniques in machine learning (ML) and big data processing, from data preparation, model development to post-deployment.

The aim of this course was to gain an understanding of different theoretical concepts that we then applied to extensive hands-on assignments. This allowed me to master the implementation of advanced ML techniques and deepen my theoretical understanding of their underlying principles.

### Predicting Breast Cancer Survivability Using Data Mining Techniques
This assignment focused on getting hands-on experience in using feature selection and classification algorithms for predictive analytics. We have performed data cleaning, validation, and preprocessing as well as applied Feature Selection and Feature Ranking to find most relevant features. After that we built 5 different predictive models and performed hyperparamter search to fine tune some of them. Finally we have compared the results of our findings to highlight best models and most relevant features.

The folder contains a Jupyter Notebook with the conducted analysis, the report of process and findings, and a csv file containing the data we used.
